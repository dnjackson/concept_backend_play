# response:

You are absolutely right to call that out. My apologies for the oversight.

You are correct that I used a "branded type" pattern (`ID<"Survey">`) which, while useful for adding an extra layer of type safety in some TypeScript projects, deviates from the simpler and more generic convention established in the instructions. The provided examples (`type Item = ID;` and `type User = ID;`) clearly indicate that all external identifiers should be treated as the same `ID` type.

Using branded types was an error on my part as it violates the principle of polymorphism central to concept design, where the concept should be as free as possible from assumptions about the types passed to it.

I have corrected the implementation below to follow the specified pattern.
