# response:

Excellent question. I did not generate code for queries for a very specific reason rooted in the provided "Concept Design" documentation.

Based on the documentation, here is the explanation:

The primary reason I did not generate any query methods is that **the provided `LikertSurvey` concept specification did not define any explicit queries.**

The "Concept queries" section of the documentation you provided states:

> Explicit query specifications are often not required since the concept state is assumed to be visible, so that straightforward queries of the state do not need to be defined in advance. It can be useful, though, to define queries for particularly significant and non-trivial observations of the state.

My implementation adheres strictly to this principle and the specification I was given. Since the spec only listed **actions** (`createSurvey`, `addQuestion`, etc.) and did not list any **queries** (which would have names starting with `_`, like `_getResponsesForSurvey`), I only implemented the specified actions.

In a real-world application using this concept, another part of the system (like an API layer or a service that syncs with this concept) would be responsible for querying the underlying MongoDB collections (`surveys`, `questions`, `responses`) to retrieve data for display to the user.

However, if the design required more complex, reusable, or "non-trivial" data retrieval, we would add them to the concept specification. For example, we could have specified queries like:

* `_getResponsesForSurvey (survey: Survey): (responses: Response[])`
  * This would retrieve all responses associated with all questions for a given survey.
* `_getAverageScoreForQuestion (question: Question): (average: Number)`
  * This is a "non-trivial observation" that involves an aggregation, making it a perfect candidate for an explicit query within the concept itself.
* `_getSurveyWithQuestions (survey: Survey): (surveyDetails: SurveyDetails)`
  * This could return a composite object containing the survey's information and a list of all its associated questions.

If these queries had been part of the initial specification, I would have implemented them as methods on the `LikertSurveyConcept` class with names prefixed by an underscore (e.g., `_getResponsesForSurvey`).
