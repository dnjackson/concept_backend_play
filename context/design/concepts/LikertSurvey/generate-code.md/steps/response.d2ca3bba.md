# response:

To implement the `LikertSurvey` concept, we will create a TypeScript class `LikertSurveyConcept` that manages surveys, questions, and user responses. The implementation will use MongoDB for persistence, with collections for surveys, questions, and responses. All methods will be asynchronous and handle error conditions by returning an object with an `error` key, as specified.
