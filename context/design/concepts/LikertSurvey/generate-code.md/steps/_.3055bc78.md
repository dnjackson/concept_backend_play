# Commenting

Every action should have a comment including its signature, its requirements, and effects:

```typescript
  /**
   * createLabel (name: String): (label: Label)
   *
   * **requires** no Label with the given `name` already exists
   *
   * **effects** creates a new Label `l`; sets the name of `l` to `name`; returns `l` as `label`
   */
```

**concept** LikertSurvey \[User]

**purpose** understand group sentiment on a set of topics by aggregating quantitative feedback

**principle** if an owner creates a survey with several questions and shares it, and multiple users respond to the questions, then the owner can view an aggregated summary of the responses for each question.

**state**

```
a set of Surveys with
    a title String
    an owner User

a set of Questions with
    a stem String
    a survey Survey  -- Links a question to its parent survey

a set of Responses with
    a responder User
    a question Question
    a choice Number
```

**actions**

createSurvey (title: String, owner: User): (survey: Survey)
**requires** title is non-empty
**effects** creates a new `Survey` with the given title and owner and returns it

addQuestion (stem: String, survey: Survey): (question: Question)
**requires** stem is non-empty and survey exists
**effects** creates a new `Question` with the given stem, associates it with the given survey, and returns it

removeQuestion (question: Question)
**requires** question exists
**effects** removes the specified question and all `Response` entities associated with it

respondToQuestion (question: Question, responder: User, choice: Number)
**requires**

* question exists
* choice is an integer between 1 and 5
  **effects**
* delete any existing response to this question
* creates a new `Response` linking the responder, question, and choice

**queries**

\_getSurveyQuestions (survey: Survey): (question: Question)
**requires** survey exists
**effects** returns the set of all Questions whose survey is the given survey

\_getSurveyTitle (survey: Survey): (title: String)
**requires** survey exists
**effects** returns the title of the survey

\_getSurveyOwner (survey: Survey): (owner: String)
**requires** survey exists
**effects** returns the owner of the survey

\_getQuestionStem (question: String): (stem: String)
**requires** survey exists
**effects** returns the stem of the question

\_getQuestionResponseCounts (question: Question): (counts: Number\[])
**requires** question exists
**effects** returns an array of counts of responses by choice number (that is, the nth element is the number of responses with choice n+1). Remember that all queries return an array, so the result is an array containing an array.

\_analyzeSentiment (question: Question): (sentiment: String)
**effects**
This query analyzes all responses for a given `question` and returns a string indicating the overall sentiment. The logic is as follows:

1. Collect the `score` from every `Response` where the `question` matches the input `question`.
2. If there are no responses, return "neutral".
3. Calculate the average and standard deviation of all collected scores.
4. Return a sentiment string based on these rules:
   * If the average score is greater than 3.5, return "positive".
   * If the average score is less than 2.5, return "negative".
   * If the standard deviation is greater than 1.5 (indicating a high degree of variance and polarization), return "bimodal".
   * Otherwise, return "mixed".

\_getSurveyQuestions (survey: Survey): (question: Question)
**requires** the given survey exists
**effects** returns an array of `Question`  whose `survey` field matches the input `survey`

\_getUserSurveys (user: User): (survey: Survey)
**requires** the given user exists
**effects** returns an array of all `Survey` identities where the `owner` field matches the input `user`
