# solution

The provided test file has several TypeScript compilation errors. These errors stem from a single root cause: attempting to access properties on a union type without first using a type guard. The actions and queries in `LikertSurveyConcept` correctly return a union type that includes a potential `error` object (e.g., `{ survey: ID } | { error: string }`). The tests must verify that an error was not returned before accessing the properties of the success object.

Additionally, a formatting artifact `# trace:` was incorrectly included as a line of code in the test file, causing a syntax error.

The solution involves two changes:

1. Adding `assert("property" in result)` checks after each query and action call within the tests. This acts as a type guard, satisfying the TypeScript compiler that the property exists before it is accessed.
2. Removing the extraneous `# trace:` line from the file.

Here is the corrected test file.
