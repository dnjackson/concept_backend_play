# why zero tests run

When I run the tests, it says:

```
deno test -A src/concepts/LikertSurvey/LikertSurveyConcept.test.ts 
Check file:///Users/dnj/Repos/concept_backend_play/src/concepts/LikertSurvey/LikertSurveyConcept.test.ts
running 0 tests from ./src/concepts/LikertSurvey/LikertSurveyConcept.test.ts

ok | 0 passed | 0 failed (10ms)
```

Is that a bug in the test file?
