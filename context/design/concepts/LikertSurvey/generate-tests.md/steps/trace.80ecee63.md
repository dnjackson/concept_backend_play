# trace:

The execution of the test file, particularly the `Principle Test`, demonstrates the concept's intended workflow.

1. **Setup**: A test database is initialized. A `LikertSurveyConcept` instance is created. IDs for an owner and several responders are defined.
2. **`createSurvey`**: The owner creates a survey named "Team Satisfaction". The action succeeds and returns a new `survey` ID. The state now contains one `Survey` document.
3. **`addQuestion`**: The owner adds two questions to this survey: "How satisfied are you with work-life balance?" and "How do you rate team collaboration?". Both actions succeed, returning unique `question` IDs. The state now contains two `Question` documents linked to the survey.
4. **`respondToQuestion`**: Three different users submit their answers.
   * For the first question, responses are `5` and `4`.
   * For the second question, responses are `1`, `2`, and `5`.
   * The state now contains five `Response` documents, each linking a user, a question, and a choice.
5. **`_getQuestionResults` (Query 1)**: The test queries the results for the first question. It aggregates the responses and correctly returns a map showing one response for choice `4` and one for choice `5`. This confirms the aggregation logic.
6. **`_analyzeSentiment` (Query 1)**: The test analyzes the sentiment for the first question. Based on the high average score (4.5), it correctly returns "positive". This confirms the sentiment analysis for positive consensus.
7. **`_getQuestionResults` (Query 2)**: The test queries the results for the second question, correctly returning a map showing one response each for choices `1`, `2`, and `5`.
8. **`_analyzeSentiment` (Query 2)**: The test analyzes the sentiment for the second question. The responses are polarized at both ends of the scale, leading to a high standard deviation. The concept correctly identifies this pattern and returns "bimodal", demonstrating its ability to detect divisive topics.
9. **Teardown**: The test completes, and the test database client is closed. The database itself is dropped automatically before the next test file runs.

This trace confirms that the `LikertSurveyConcept` successfully models the entire lifecycle from survey creation to response collection and finally to insightful analysis, thereby fulfilling its specified **purpose** and **principle**.
