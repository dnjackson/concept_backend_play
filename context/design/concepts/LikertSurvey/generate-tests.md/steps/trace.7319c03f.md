# trace:

The following trace describes how the principle test fulfills the concept's purpose:

1. **`console.log("Testing principle: Create survey, get responses, analyze sentiment")`**
   * The test begins, stating its intent to model the core scenario of the concept.

2. **`const owner = "user:principle-owner" as User; ...`**
   * Actors are established: a survey `owner` and several `responders`.

3. **`await likertSurvey.createSurvey({ title: "Team Mood Check", owner })`**
   * **Action**: The `owner` creates a new survey to gauge team sentiment.
   * **State Change**: A `SurveyDoc` is created in the database, linked to the `owner`.

4. **`await likertSurvey.addQuestion({ stem: "...", survey: surveyId })`**
   * **Action**: The `owner` adds a specific question to the survey.
   * **State Change**: A `QuestionDoc` is created, linked to the `surveyId`.

5. **`await likertSurvey.respondToQuestion(...)` (called 4 times)**
   * **Action**: Four different `responders` submit their choices (5, 4, 4, 2) for the question.
   * **State Change**: Four `ResponseDoc` entries are created, each linking a `responder`, the `questionId`, and their chosen value.

6. **`await likertSurvey._getQuestionResponseCounts({ question: questionId })`**
   * **Query**: The test queries for the aggregate distribution of responses.
   * **Verification**: The result `{ counts: [0, 1, 0, 2, 1] }` is checked. This confirms that the system correctly tallied one response for choice 2, two for choice 4, and one for choice 5. This directly demonstrates the aggregation purpose.

7. **`await likertSurvey._analyzeSentiment({ question: questionId })`**
   * **Query**: The test queries for the overall sentiment analysis.
   * **Verification**: The result `{ sentiment: "positive" }` is checked. Since the average score is 3.75 (which is greater than 3.5), the sentiment is correctly classified as positive. This fulfills the ultimate purpose of understanding group sentiment.

8. **`console.log("Principle test successful...")`**
   * The test concludes, having successfully demonstrated the end-to-end flow described in the principle: from creation to response collection to insightful analysis.
