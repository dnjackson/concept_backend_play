# Dictionaries as arguments and results

Note that the arguments and results of actions and queries are always dictionaries. For example if an action or a query has the signature

```
foo (a: A, b: B): (c: C)
```

this means that the implementation should take a dictionary with fields named `a` and `b`, and return a dictionary with a field `c`.
