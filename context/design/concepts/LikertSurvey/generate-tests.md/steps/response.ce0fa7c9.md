# response:

Of course. The compilation errors you're seeing are due to TypeScript's strict type checking on union types. When a method can return either a success object (e.g., `{ survey: ID }`) or an error object (`{ error: string }`), you must first check which type you have before accessing its properties.

Here is the corrected test file. I've added assertions to act as type guards, ensuring that the code only proceeds if the actions return a success object, which resolves the compilation errors.
