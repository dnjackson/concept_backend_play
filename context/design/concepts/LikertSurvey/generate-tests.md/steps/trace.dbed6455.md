# trace:

The test suite executes the following trace to validate the `LikertSurvey` concept's principle:

1. **Setup**: A test database is initialized, and an instance of `LikertSurveyConcept` is created.
2. **`createSurvey`**: An `owner` user creates a new survey named "Team Satisfaction". The action is expected to succeed and return a unique `survey` ID.
3. **`addQuestion` (x2)**: The `owner` adds two questions to the newly created survey:
   * "How do you feel about the work-life balance?" (q1)
   * "Are you happy with the current tooling?" (q2)
     Both actions are expected to succeed, returning unique `question` IDs.
4. **`respondToQuestion` (x6)**: Three different users (`responder1`, `responder2`, `responder3`) submit their responses to both questions.
   * For q1, the responses are `[5, 4, 5]`.
   * For q2, the responses are `[4, 1, 2]`.
5. **Verification using Queries**:
   * **`_getQuestionResponseCounts(q1)`**: The test queries the response counts for the first question. It asserts that the result is `[0, 0, 0, 1, 2]`, correctly tallying one response of `4` and two responses of `5`.
   * **`_analyzeSentiment(q1)`**: Based on the high average score of the responses, the test asserts that the sentiment is calculated as "positive".
   * **`_getQuestionResponseCounts(q2)`**: The test queries the counts for the second question, asserting the result is `[1, 1, 0, 1, 0]`, reflecting the diverse opinions.
   * **`_analyzeSentiment(q2)`**: Based on the low average score of the responses (2.33), the test asserts that the sentiment is correctly identified as "negative".

This trace demonstrates the end-to-end flow of creating a survey, gathering feedback, and analyzing the results, thus confirming that the concept successfully fulfills its purpose. The additional action and query tests ensure that each component of the concept behaves correctly in isolation and handles edge cases as specified by its requirements.
