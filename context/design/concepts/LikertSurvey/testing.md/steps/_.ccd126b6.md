# Legible testing

* Each test should output what it is doing and the trace of any actions, to help with debugging and increasing confidence that the concept or action is doing what it says.
* Principle tests and tests involving multiple actions should explain how it aligns with expectations.
* For action tests, the output should explain how requirements are met and how effects are confirmed.

**concept** LikertSurvey \[User]

**purpose** understand group sentiment on a set of topics by aggregating quantitative feedback

**principle** if an owner creates a survey with several questions and shares it, and multiple users respond to the questions, then the owner can view an aggregated summary of the responses for each question.

**state**

```
a set of Surveys with
    a title String
    an owner User

a set of Questions with
    a stem String
    a survey Survey  -- Links a question to its parent survey

a set of Responses with
    a responder User
    a question Question
    a choice Number
```

**actions**

createSurvey (title: String, owner: User): (survey: Survey)
**requires** title is non-empty
**effects** creates a new `Survey` with the given title and owner and returns it

addQuestion (stem: String, survey: Survey): (question: Question)
**requires** stem is non-empty and survey exists
**effects** creates a new `Question` with the given stem, associates it with the given survey, and returns it

removeQuestion (question: Question)
**requires** question exists
**effects** removes the specified question and all `Response` entities associated with it

respondToQuestion (question: Question, responder: User, choice: Number)
**requires**

* question exists
* choice is an integer between 1 and 5
  **effects**
* delete any existing response to this question
* creates a new `Response` linking the responder, question, and choice

**queries**

\_getSurveyQuestions (survey: Survey): (questions: set of Question)
**requires** survey exists
**effects** returns the set of all Questions where `Question.survey` is the given survey

\_getQuestionResults (question: Question): (results: map of Number to Number)
**requires** question exists
**effects** returns a map where each key is a choice value (e.g., 1-5) and its value is the count of Responses for this question with that choice

\_analyzeSentiment (question: Question): (sentiment: String)
**effects**
This query analyzes all responses for a given `question` and returns a string indicating the overall sentiment. The logic is as follows:

1. Collect the `score` from every `Response` where the `question` matches the input `question`.
2. If there are no responses, return "neutral".
3. Calculate the average and standard deviation of all collected scores.
4. Return a sentiment string based on these rules:
   * If the average score is greater than 3.5, return "positive".
   * If the average score is less than 2.5, return "negative".
   * If the standard deviation is greater than 1.5 (indicating a high degree of variance and polarization), return "bimodal".
   * Otherwise, return "mixed".
