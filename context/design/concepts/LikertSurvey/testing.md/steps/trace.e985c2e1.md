# trace:

The test file above contains a trace that models the concept's principle. Here is a description of that trace:

1. **Setup**: An `author` ("author:A") and a `respondent` ("respondent:X") are established. The `LikertSurveyConcept` is instantiated.
2. **Author Creates Survey**: The `author` performs the `createSurvey` action to create a new survey called "Workspace Comfort" with a 1-5 scale. The test verifies this action succeeds and stores the new survey's ID.
3. **Author Adds Questions**: The `author` performs the `addQuestion` action twice, adding two questions ("How is the chair comfort?" and "How is the office lighting?") to the survey created in the previous step. The test verifies that both questions are created successfully.
4. **Respondent Submits Answers**: The `respondent` performs the `submitResponse` action for each of the two questions, providing scores of `4` and `2`, respectively.
5. **Author Views Responses**: Finally, to complete the scenario, the `author` uses the `_getSurveyResponses` query to fetch all responses associated with their survey. The test asserts that it retrieves exactly two responses and that their values (`4` and `2`) match what the `respondent` submitted.

This sequence of actions and queries directly follows the narrative of the principle, demonstrating that the concept's implementation correctly supports its intended use case from start to finish.
