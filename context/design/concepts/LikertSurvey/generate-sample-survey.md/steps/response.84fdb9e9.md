Of course. The errors you're seeing are due to TypeScript's type inference. The `getDb()` function returns a tuple `[Db, MongoClient]`, but without explicit typing, TypeScript is inferring the type of `db` and `client` as a union `(Db | MongoClient)`, which is too broad.

The fix is to explicitly type the destructured variables. This will correctly inform TypeScript that `db` is of type `Db` and `client` is of type `MongoClient`, resolving both errors.
