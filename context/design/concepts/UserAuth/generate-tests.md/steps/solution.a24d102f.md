# solution:

To fulfill the request, I will augment both the concept implementation and its corresponding test file.

1. **Update `UserAuthConcept.ts`**: I will add two query methods, `_getUserById` and `_getUserByUsername`, to the `UserAuthConcept` class. These methods will allow retrieving user information from the database, which is necessary for the new tests. As per the specification, these query methods will be prefixed with an underscore (`_`) and will return an array of results.
2. **Update `UserAuthConcept.test.ts`**: I will add a new `Deno.test` suite dedicated to testing these queries. This new suite will:
   * Register a user to create a known state.
   * Test the successful retrieval of this user by both ID and username.
   * Test the failure cases, ensuring that querying for non-existent users returns an empty array as expected.
   * Verify that the data returned by the queries is accurate.

This approach ensures the concept is enhanced with the necessary query functionality and that this functionality is thoroughly validated by legible, well-documented tests.
