# trace:

The primary test case, `UserAuthConcept: principle trace - register, login, query, logout`, models the key scenario described by the concept's principle. Here is a trace of the actions and state changes:

1. **`register({ username: "diana", password: "passwordxyz" })`**:
   * **Requires**: The username "diana" does not exist. This is met as the database is empty.
   * **Effects**: A new user document is created in the `UserAuth.users` collection with `username: "diana"` and a password. A new `user` ID is returned.
   * **State After**: `UserAuth.users` contains one document for "diana". `UserAuth.sessions` is empty.

2. **`login({ username: "diana", password: "passwordxyz" })`**:
   * **Requires**: A user exists with the matching username and password. This is met by the user created in step 1.
   * **Effects**: A new session document is created in the `UserAuth.sessions` collection, linking a newly generated `token` to "diana"'s user ID. This token is returned.
   * **State After**: `UserAuth.users` is unchanged. `UserAuth.sessions` contains one document.

3. **`_getUserFromToken({ token: ... })` & `_getUsernameFromToken({ token: ... })`**:
   * **Requires**: A session exists with the provided token. This is met by the session created in step 2.
   * **Effects**: The queries successfully look up the session, find the associated user ID, and return the user ID and username respectively. No state is changed.

4. **`logout({ token: ... })`**:
   * **Requires**: A session exists with the provided token. This is met.
   * **Effects**: The session document corresponding to the token is deleted from the `UserAuth.sessions` collection.
   * **State After**: `UserAuth.users` is unchanged. `UserAuth.sessions` is empty again.

5. **`_getUserFromToken({ token: ... })` (post-logout)**:
   * **Requires**: A session exists with the provided token. This requirement is now **not met**.
   * **Effects**: The query fails to find a session and returns an `{ error: "Invalid token." }` object, confirming the token is no longer valid.

This sequence confirms that the `UserAuthConcept` correctly implements its principle: it allows a registered user to gain temporary, verifiable access via a session token, which can be explicitly revoked.
