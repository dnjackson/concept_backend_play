# trace:

The following trace describes how the `UserAuth` concept's principle is fulfilled through a sequence of actions, demonstrating its core purpose.

1. **Initial State**
   * The concept starts with an empty state. The `UserAuth.users` collection in the database contains no documents.

2. **Action: `register`**
   * **Call**: `userAuth.register({ username: "testUserPrinciple", password: "password123" })`
   * **`requires` check**: The concept checks if a user with the username `"testUserPrinciple"` already exists. Since the collection is empty, this condition is met. The password is also longer than 8 characters, satisfying the other condition.
   * **`effects` execution**:
     * A new, unique `User` ID is generated (e.g., `user_abc123`).
     * The password `"password123"` is securely hashed.
     * A new document is inserted into the `UserAuth.users` collection: `{ _id: "user_abc123", username: "testUserPrinciple", passwordHash: "<hashed_value>" }`.
   * **Result**: The action successfully completes and returns `{ user: "user_abc123" }`.

3. **Intermediate State**
   * The `UserAuth.users` collection now contains one document representing the newly registered user.

4. **Action: `login`**
   * **Call**: `userAuth.login({ username: "testUserPrinciple", password: "password123" })`
   * **`requires` check**:
     * The concept queries the database for a user with `username: "testUserPrinciple"`. It finds the document created in the previous step.
     * The provided password `"password123"` is hashed using the same algorithm.
     * This newly generated hash is compared against the `passwordHash` stored in the user's document. They match.
   * **`effects` execution**:
     * Since the credentials are valid, the action prepares to return the authenticated user's ID.
   * **Result**: The action successfully completes and returns `{ user: "user_abc123" }`.

5. **Final Outcome**
   * The caller receives the same user ID from the `login` action that was returned by the `register` action, confirming that the user has been successfully authenticated. The principle is fulfilled.
