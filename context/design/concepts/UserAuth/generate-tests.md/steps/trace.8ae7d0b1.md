# trace:

The test file includes a dedicated test step named `"Principle: Full authentication flow"` that logs its execution trace. Here's what the output of that trace will look like, demonstrating how the principle is fulfilled:

```
# Trace: Testing the operational principle of UserAuth
  1. Registering a new user...
     -> { user: "ID:<some-uuid>" }
  2. Logging in with the correct credentials...
     -> { token: "ID:<another-uuid>" }
  3. Verifying identity with the token...
     -> _getUserFromToken(...) -> [ { user: "ID:<some-uuid>" } ]
     -> _getUsernameFromToken(...) -> [ { username: "principle_user" } ]
  4. Logging out...
     -> logout(...) -> {}
  5. Verifying the token is now invalid...
     -> _getUserFromToken(...) -> [ { error: "Invalid token." } ]
# Trace: Principle test completed successfully.
```
