# Concept Design Background

Concept design organizes software into concepts, which are independent and familiar units of functionality with a single purpose. A concept specification contains:

* **concept**: a descriptive name balancing generality of use and appropriate specificity
* **purpose**: the reason for why this concept exists, and what it enables
* **principle**: a motivating scenario that establishes how the concept achieves its purpose
* **state**: a simple state modeling language meant to capture the basic relationships between the necessary information
* **actions**: a set of events that (largely) mutate the state or update represented information, written as a set of pre/postconditions: what the action **requires** in order to occur, and what **effects** it has

Concepts are uniquely motivated by the fact that they are:

1. Completely independent of one another in terms of dependencies and state.
2. Work off generic parameters, and cannot know about specific types.
3. Strongly grounded in a user-relevant purpose, and not just a structure for software.

Can you critique this concept spec that a student wrote?

```
* purpose: allow users to add each other as friends to share information with

* principle: users may add and remove each other as friends. These friendships define boundaries regarding who has access to see whose information.

* state: a set of Users with

- a set of friends User

- a set of sentRequests Users

- a set of receivedRequests Users

* actions:

- sendRequest (sender: User, receiver: User)

* *requires* sender and receiver to exist, sender is not the receiver, receiver not already in sender's set of friends or sent requests

* *effects* adds sender to receiver's set of received requests, adds receiver to sender's set of sent requests

- acceptRequest (sender: User, receiver: User)

* *requires* request from sender exists in receiver's set of received requests

* *effects* removes sender from receiver's set of received requests, removes receiver from sender's set of sent requests, adds sender to receiver's set of friends and vice versa

- removeFriend (user: User, to_be_removed_friend: User)

* *requires* to_be_removed_friend to be in user's set of friends

* *effects* removes to_be_removed_friend from user's set of friends and vice versa
