Please produce a new version of this specification that hardwires the scale to be numbers from 1 to 5, with the following meanings

1 strongly disagree
2 disagree
3 neutral
4 agree
5 strongly agree

and add a query that takes a question and returns one of the following depending on the set of responses: 

"positive", "negative", "bimodal", "mixed"



# response:

Of course. Here is a new concept specification for an `AgreementScale` that hardwires the scale to be numbers from 1 to 5, with the meanings you specified, and includes the requested query to analyze the set of responses.

This specification is written according to the structure and principles outlined in the document you provided.

***

### Concept: AgreementScale

This concept models a system for collecting responses on a fixed 5-point scale, often known as a Likert scale. The scale is defined as follows:

*   **1**: Strongly Disagree
*   **2**: Disagree
*   **3**: Neutral
*   **4**: Agree
*   **5**: Strongly Agree

---

**concept** AgreementScale \[User, Question]

**purpose** to quantify and categorize collective agreement or disagreement on a given subject.

**principle** if a question is posed and multiple users submit their responses on the 1-to-5 scale, an analysis of the responses can reveal the overall sentiment, such as whether it is generally positive, negative, or divided.

**state**

```
a set of Responses with
  a responder User
  a question Question
  a score Number
```

**actions**

respond (user: User, question: Question, score: Number)
**requires**
*   The score is an integer between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
*   No Response exists for this user and this question.
**effects**
*   A new Response is created with its `responder` set to `user`, `question` set to `question`, and `score` set to `score`.

updateResponse (user: User, question: Question, newScore: Number)
**requires**
*   The `newScore` is an integer between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
*   A Response already exists for this `user` and this `question`.
**effects**
*   The `score` of the existing Response for the given `user` and `question` is updated to `newScore`.

retractResponse (user: User, question: Question)
**requires**
*   A Response exists for this `user` and this `question`.
**effects**
*   The existing Response for the given `user` and `question` is deleted.

**queries**

analyzeSentiment (question: Question): (sentiment: String)
**effects**
This query analyzes all responses for a given `question` and returns a string indicating the overall sentiment. The logic is as follows:
1.  Collect the `score` from every `Response` where the `question` matches the input `question`.
2.  If there are no responses, return "neutral".
3.  Calculate the average and standard deviation of all collected scores.
4.  Return a sentiment string based on these rules:
    *   If the average score is greater than 3.5, return "positive".
    *   If the average score is less than 2.5, return "negative".
    *   If the standard deviation is greater than 1.5 (indicating a high degree of variance and polarization), return "bimodal".
    *   Otherwise, return "mixed".
